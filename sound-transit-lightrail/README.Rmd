## Sound Transit Light Rail System (unofficial)

The planned and existing light rail stations within the Sound Transit light rail system in Washington State.

Please note that many station locations are uncertain and are subject to change. This is **not an official representation of the light rail system** and it should not be used or represented as such.

This dataset was created by updating and modifying the original work of Reddit user [u/CheeToS](https://www.reddit.com/user/CheeToS_) (see this January 2016 [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/41a53p/heres_a_detailed_map_of_all_the_sound_transit_1/)).

### Data Dictionary

here::here("sound-transit-lightrail/data/sound-transit-lightrail-dictionary.csv") %>% 
  read_csv(na = "NA") %>% 
  kable()
```
